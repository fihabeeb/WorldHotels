# WorldHotels

During the first year of my computer science course, I was tasked with created a functional hotel booking website on my own (no group).

## Step 1

The course started by teaching us HTML and then CSS. So the first steps in the project was to create the front-end portion of the website. As this was a solo first year project, the expected quality of the final product was not so steep. We used basic HTML and CSS to create the main page, as well as the login page of the website. We learnt to use functions like Django extension
```HTML
{% extends "base.html" %}
```
and CSS classes and IDs
```CSS
    .text_Box_2_text{
    margin-left: 1%;
    margin-right: 1%;
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```
to make the development process more efficient.
